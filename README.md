# The Game Contest

Provided in this repository is a _very_ rough template to get you started on the game project. I've included the PGL library here in case you want to use it. If you want other libraries that we have used over the course of the semester (such as the english library or token scanner library) feel free to grab them from previous assignments or ask and I'll send them your way.

I tried to give you as much time as possible on this, but really had to make the deadline the start of finals. At that point you really should be focused on studying for your finals, whether it be for this class or another. I'm excited to play these!
